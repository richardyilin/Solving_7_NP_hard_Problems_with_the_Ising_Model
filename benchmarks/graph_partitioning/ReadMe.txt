This folder contains the partition archive resources from http://chriswalshaw.co.uk/partition/.

The 4 zipped files contain graphs (from the main page http://chriswalshaw.co.uk/partition/ and the colouring annexe http://chriswalshaw.co.uk/partition/index-colour.html) plus partitions from those two pages.

You can find documentation explaining the graph format at http://chriswalshaw.co.uk/jostle/. Iâ€™d suggest downloading the userguide for "the jostle serial executable" which is the very last link on the page.
